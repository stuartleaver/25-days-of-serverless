## Solution


## The Challenge

Today, we're heading to Gävle, Sweden. Though its purpose has changed over the years, current tradition has the Yule Goat pulling Father Christmas' sled to deliver presents. Every year since 1966, the Gävle Goat representing the Yule Goat has been set up at the Castle Square in Gävle. Every year, other folks follow a tradition of trying to destroy the Yule goat. It has had tremendous difficulty making it through the Yuletide unscathed, so Father Christmas wants to increase awareness through a marketing campaign. He wants you to create a social media bot that will surface content tagged with #gävlebocken, or that is shared directly through the campaign.

The only problem is that just as with the naughty elves who try to destroy the physical Yule goat, there are malicious actors trying to hijack and manipulate this campaign of good will. Implement some security precautions to make sure that those naughty elves aren't successful with the campaign and protect the bot's integrity. Azure Functions and Cognitive Services might be helpful to you.

Depending on how you choose to implement the necessary functionality revisiting previous challenges may help:

* Challenge 11: Database Trigger
* Challenge 15: Cognitive Services
* Challenge 16: Continuous Integration and Continuous Delivery
* Challenge 21: Orchestrating stateful serverless functions
* Challenge 22: Separation of secret configuration from code with Azure Key Vault
